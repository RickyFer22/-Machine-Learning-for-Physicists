## Description

Contents: Introduction (the power of deep neural networks in applications), brief discussion of the lecture outline, structure of a neural network and information processing steps, very brief introduction to python and jupyter, implementing a deep neural network efficiently in basic python (without any additional packages like tensorflow), illustration: complicated functions generated by deep neural networks

After this lecture, you will know the basic structure of a neural network and how to implement the 'forward-pass' in python, but you donâ€™t yet know how to adapt the network weights (training).

## Code

- The jupyter notebook with the code for this lecture can be found [here](../notebooks/01_MachineLearning_Basics_NeuralNetworksPython.ipynb).
- An improved version of the above notebook can be found [here](../notebooks/01 - Neural Networks with pure Python.ipynb).
- If turns out to be better for you, you can run the improved notebook directly on the cloud using Google Colab. <br>
