> üóì Online session introducing the course: April 21, 6pm (all times CEST, i.e. time in Germany)

## Description

We will discuss the lecture series program, prerequisites, and the format of the online sessions. I will also say some words about the pre-history of neural networks. Please pre-register! (Link at the top of this website, under ‚Äúmost important info‚Äù)

Suggested historical reading: [Alan Turing‚Äôs "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950)](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238), introducing what is now known as the "Turing test" for artificial intelligence. A wonderful (and very nontechnical) paper!

Further historical reading: [Rosenblatt's concept of a "Perceptron" (1957)](http://blogs.umass.edu/brain-wars/files/2016/03/rosenblatt-1957.pdf).
